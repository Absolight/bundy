Most (if not all) of the tests parse the output of log file from bundy
processes.  To make it possible, please make sure that the "Logging"
configuration contains the special keyword of "OUTPUT_OPTIONS".  The
test terrain scripts will automatically replace this keyword with
valid configuration parameters for a specific test scenario.  The
specific way of embedding the keyword should be obvious from existing
configuration files as an example.
